This is the React client side of the Fullstack App. The server side can be found at https://github.com/minhkashyu/voting-app-backend.

## User Stories

* As an authenticated user, I can keep my polls and come back later to access them.

* As an authenticated user, I can share my polls with my friends.

* As an authenticated user, I can see the aggregate results of my polls.

* As an authenticated user, I can delete polls that I decide I don't want anymore.

* As an authenticated user, I can create a poll with any number of possible items.

* As an unauthenticated or authenticated user, I can see and vote on everyone's polls.

* As an unauthenticated or authenticated user, I can see the results of polls in chart form. (This could be implemented using Chart.js or Google Charts.)

* As an authenticated user, if I don't like the options on a poll, I can create a new option.
